Design a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over a period of time if
his or her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the second day, and continues to double
each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days. Display a table showing what the
salary was for each day, and then show the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be
