In mathematics, the notation n! represents the factorial of the nonnegative integer n. The factorial of n is the product of all the nonnegative integers from 1 up 
through n. For example : 
    7! = 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 X 7 = 5,040
and
    4! = 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 = 24
Design a program that asks the user to enter a nonnegative integer and then displays the factorial of that number
