# Automobile Costs
# Design a modular program that asks the user to enter 
#the monthly costs for the following exspenses incurred from operating his or her automobile: loan payment,
# insurance, gas, oil, tires and maintenance. The program should then display the total monthly cost of these 
#exspenses, and the total annual cost of these exspenses.
