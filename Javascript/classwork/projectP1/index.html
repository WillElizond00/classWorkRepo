    <h2>History of Anime</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Early Development (1910s – 1960s)</h3></li>
            <p> 
                 The origins of anime can be traced back to the early 20th century when Japanese filmmakers 
                 began experimenting with animation techniques pioneered in France, Germany, and the United States.
                 During the 1910s, the first short animated films were created in Japan, though these often simple and experimental works are barely recognized today due
                 to their scarcity and the poor preservation of early film reels. The interwar period saw limited development in the industry due to economic difficulties and 
                 the influence of the government, which used animation for propaganda during the Second World War. After the war, a young artist named Osamu Tezuka emerged 
                 and revolutionized the anime industry. His works, notably "Astro Boy" (Tetsuwan Atomu) which started airing in 1963, introduced narrative depth, aesthetic quality, 
                 and production values that had not been seen before in Japanese animation. Tezuka's style and storytelling became the gold standard and laid down 
                 the fundamental principles of what anime would become.
            </p>

            <li><h3>The Rise of TV Anime (1970s – 1980s)</h3></li>
            <p>
                As television became a household commodity, the 1970s and 1980s marked the beginning of anime's golden age. The medium shifted from film-only releases to regular 
                TV series, which allowed for ongoing stories with more complex characters and plotlines. The 1970s introduced many new genres and saw the rise of mecha 
                (robot) anime, like "Mobile Suit Gundam," which not only revolutionized anime with its realistic war narrative and mechanical designs but also paved the way 
                for merchandise-driven productions. The 1980s further cemented anime as a cultural phenomenon with series such as "Dragon Ball," which combined Chinese martial arts
                mythology with dynamic character progression, and "Saint Seiya," which blended Greek mythology with high-stakes battle sequences. These series captivated audiences 
                with their unique blend of storytelling, art style, and character development, setting the foundation for international success.
                </p>
            <li><h3>Mainstream Global Success (1990s – 2000s)</h3></li>
            <p>
                The 1990s marked a major turning point for anime as it embraced technological advancements and expanded globally. The release of "Neon Genesis Evangelion" 
                in 1995 changed the landscape of anime by introducing a more psychological and philosophical narrative to the mecha genre, garnering a massive following both 
                in Japan and internationally. This period also saw the rise of anime films with the success of Studio Ghibli and its co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, whose works 
                like "Princess Mononoke" and "Spirited Away" received international critical acclaim and awards. In the 2000s, the popularity of anime continued to grow 
                with series such as "Naruto" and "Bleach," which appealed to a global audience through compelling stories of adventure, growth, and conflict. This era 
                solidified anime’s place in global pop culture, expanding its influence beyond Asia to Western markets.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Contemporary and Digital Expansion (2010s – Present)</h3></li>
            <p>
                In the most recent decade, anime has continued to evolve with the digital age. The proliferation of streaming services has made anime more accessible than ever 
                before, allowing for simultaneous global releases and thus fostering a worldwide community of anime fans. Contemporary anime like "Attack on Titan" and 
                "My Hero Academia" have enjoyed unprecedented popularity, thanks to their innovative animation techniques and universal themes that resonate with a diverse audience. 
                Additionally, the rise of web-based manga adaptations and light novel series has influenced the production of anime, resulting in a wide array of genres and stories. 
                This period has not only seen the growth of anime fandom but also an increase in the collaboration between Japanese studios and international media companies, further 
                enhancing the production quality and global appeal of anime.
