# Logic Chapter Nine Exercise Seven

# Design an application that has an array of at least 20 integers. It should call a module that uses the sequential search algorithm to locate one of the values.
# The module should keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes until it finds the value. Then the program should call another module 
# that uses the binary search algorithm to locate the same value. It should also keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes. Display these values on screen

my_list = [1,2,3,4]
print(my_list[-3:-2])
