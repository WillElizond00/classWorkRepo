# William Elizondo 
# Chapter 14 Exercise 2 
# 
# Design a class named Car that has the following fields:
# yearModel: The yearModel field is an Integer that holds the car's year model.
# make: The make field references a string that holds the make of the car.
# speed: The speed field is an Integer that holds the car's current speed.
# In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other methods:
#
# Constructor: The constructor should accept the car's year model and make as arguments. These
# values should be assigned to the object's yearModel and make fields. The constructor should also assign 0 to the speed field.
#
# Accessors: Design an appropriate accessor methods to get the values stored in an object's yearModel, make, and speed fields.
#
# accelerate : The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed field each time it is called. 
# brake : The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed field each time it is called.
#
# Next, design a program that creates a Car object, and then calls the accelerate method five times.
# After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
# Then call the brake method five times. After each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
